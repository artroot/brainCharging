## How much change should I give?
Write a cash.c program that asks the user how much the rest is to be issued, and then issues the minimum amount of coins that can be used to give the rest of it.

Use the get_float function to get input from the user, and printf to output your result. Assume that you have 25, 10, 5 and 1 cent coins available.
